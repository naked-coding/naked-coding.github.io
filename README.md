| Free as in free beer                  | A corporate ploy to make you buy things manufactured at a Chinese or Bangladeshi sweatshop                              |
| Pure freedom                          | Restrain not just your blood circulation but your free spirit, too                                                      |
| Gay as in happy                       | Just ... gay. Even organizers of a gay pride parade will think you too gay for your own good                            |
| Rebellious and free spirited          | Let's face it. If you work anywhere near a tech bubble, even your boss is bound to have a boudoir                       |
| Socially unacceptable. Thus cool      | Already socially accepted. Nobody is going to bat an eye if you show up in thigh highs and high heels #StunningAndBrave |
| Back to the roots                     | Fruits of a post-modernist hellscape                                                                                    |
| Unisex                                | Males in thigh highs look fucking cringe                                                                                |
| Takes no effort away from programming | Wastes time and money on unimportant things                                                                             |
